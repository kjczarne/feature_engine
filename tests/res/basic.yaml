# boolean yes/no features

# context features - describe the patterns of usage
# performance requirements features - speed and accuraty levels, timesync, etc.
# representation features - describe how the information is represented
# interface requirement features - describe how the users or system components will talk to one another
# operational features - related to the runtime functions that make the program fulfill its purpose
# methodology features - design and development methodology features

# open-ended possibility to define a "complex" relationship that cannot be simply presented

# define possible relationships between features
